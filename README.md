# Image-colorization
üñºÔ∏è Image Colorization with Deep Learning This project implements automatic image colorization using deep learning. It takes grayscale images as input and generates realistic color versions using a convolutional neural network (CNN).  Key Features:  Converts black-and-white photos to color  Built with Python and TensorFlow/PyTorch
