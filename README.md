# ðŸŽ¨ Image Colorization with Deep Learning

This project colorizes black-and-white images using pretrained deep learning models, specifically the **SIGGRAPH** and **ECCV16** models developed for automatic image colorization.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Converts grayscale images to realistic color images
- Uses two pretrained models: `SIGGRAPH` and `ECCV16` (based on research by Richard Zhang et al.)
- Based on CNN architectures trained on large datasets like ImageNet
- Python implementation (e.g., OpenCV, Caffe/PyTorch, etc.)
- Compatible with CPU or GPU inference

## ðŸ§  Models Used

| Model     | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **ECCV16** | Published in ECCV 2016. Introduced a CNN-based automatic colorization approach using classification over quantized ab values. |
| **SIGGRAPH** | Improved version presented at SIGGRAPH 2017. Includes better image priors and user-guided support. |

Models are based on research by:
